# VaxVerify

A free, open-source "vaccine passport" verifier.

### Information

VaxVerify is an open-source verifier app for international standard "vaccine passport" QR proofs.
These QR codes are digitally signed by their issuing party (typically a local government or health authority).

The majority of Canadian provinces using a QR proof system currently adopt the Smart Health Cards protocol (https://smarthealth.cards), a standard using JSON Web Tokens to securely encode health information.
Information currently included by Canadian provinces includes: Full name, date of birth, vaccine history (COVID-19 related only) such as date, vaccine type and location received. Proofs may also store medical exemption information for people with exempted medical conditions. More information regarding exemptions is currently unknown.

In addition to SHC, support has also recently been added for EU Green Pass proofs. This feature is currently in beta and may not work as expected. Please file an Issue if you experience any problems with EU Green Pass.
